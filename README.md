## **Introduction | Overview**

Travel planning is exciting but often overwhelming, requiring research, budgeting, and decision-making. **TourGenie** simplifies this process by integrating AI to create detailed, personalized travel itineraries. 

Built with **Angular** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend, TourGenie leverages the **Gemini Large Language Model (1.5 Flash)** to offer real-time, AI-powered travel planning for users.

This guide is designed for beginner to intermediate developers interested in web development, API integration, and AI-enhanced applications. By the end of this guide, you’ll learn how to:

- Build a web interface for creating and managing travel plans.
- Use **Node.js** to interact with the **Gemini Large Language Model (1.5 Flash)**.
- Integrate AI to generate customized itineraries based on user inputs.
